Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response
that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:

You are part of a search engine that helps users find relevant context passages given their queries. To improve the
relevance of retrieval methods, artificial queries must be generated. Read the context passage and write a query
that a user would issue if they would seek to access the passage mentioned below. Provide reasoning for your
generation.

Consider the following factors when generating the query:
1. Does this passage fully answer the query?
2. Does this query seek information that could only be answered by this given passage?

Respond in JSON where the generated query has the key "query" and the reasoning has the key "reasoning."

### Input:
